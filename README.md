# Identifying Melanoma in images of skin lesions

The purpose of this project was to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict if based on its image, a skin lession is cancerious (malignant) or non-cancerious (benign). The dataset was hosted on kaggle as tfrecord files. First, I created an efficient data input pipeline using Tensorflow, which allowed me to efficinetly run experiments. Next, I created various data augmentation functions to my data input pipeline that effectively increased the size of my training dataset. Next Tensorflow and Keras were used to create Convolutional Neural Network ("CNN") machine learning models (both transfer learning models, and models that were trained from scratch were incorporated into my experiments). For training, I used both Google Colaboratory, and Kaggle Notebooks, which allowed me to Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) machines specifically designed for machine learning, Tensor Processing Units (TPU), which reduces the time it takes to conduct an experiment compared to using a Graphics Processing Unit, or my home laptop. After training, I used matplotlib pyplot to graph various metrics of my model. Once I am ready to make predictions, I used Tensorflow to pass my test dataset into my machine learning model, and stored the output in a Pandas DataFrame that was exported to a CSV file. 

## Questions:
1. Which pre-trained models work best with the dataset I am using?
2. What model architecture will maximize the area under the curve ("AUC" -- a metric for imbalanced data) for a model being trained from scratch?
3. Most importantly, what is the probability a given image of a skin lession is malignant?
